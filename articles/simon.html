            The chair of the UBC Board of Governors, Michael Korenberg, has resigned in the wake of “liking” tweets that are against the Black Lives Matter movement. Korenberg’s resignation comes after the campus group “Students Against Bigotry” posted screenshots of his controversial social media activity, which contained interactions that indicated his support for far-right comments. The most prominent tweet that he liked compared the Black Lives Matter movement to the "paramilitary wings" of Hitler and Mussolini. He also actively liked tweets that praised U.S. President Donald Trump as well as dismissive and ignorant comments aimed toward the Black Lives Matter movement.<br><br>
            The university announced on June 20th that Korenberg would be stepping down from his position, saying that they recognize Korenberg's activity "has been deeply hurtful to members of our community and that UBC has zero-tolerance for racism and recognizes that real harm is created from both overt and structural racism".<br><br>
            In response to the backlash as a result of his social media activity, Korenberg issued an apology, where he acknowledged that some content he had liked “supported regressive voices”. He also expressed that he wanted to be “part of the solution”, and decided to resign because he felt that it was the right thing to do. Additionally, he claimed that he was a proponent of the Black Lives Matter movement and promised to continue his advocacy of human rights.<br><br>
            In another statement addressing Korenberg’s resignation, B.C.’s Minister of Advanced Education Melanie Mark asserted that “Our government and UBC are deeply committed to inclusion, justice, and equality for all.”<br><br>
            UBC Board of Governors vice-chair Sandra Cawley will serve as interim board chair until a new chair is elected.
