            The impact of COVID 19 is extremely apparent in all aspects of our lifestyle. In relation, our new normal will probably remain like this until the vaccine is distributed widely. However, it seems tight spaces are changing the most and supermarkets are one of them.
            <br><br>
            Ever since the social distancing measures placed on B.C in late March, the government and health officials took their immediate attention to supermarkets. But is the change purely inconvenient for us consumers or is it for the good of ourselves in the situations we are facing right now? To look at this, we must look at the pros of cons of this new change implemented in supermarkets.
            <br><br>
            Supermarkets were never the most sanitary. There have been countless reports about dirty surfaces on shopping carts, product shelves, bathrooms, and even the products we buy. On top of the unsanitary surfaces, supermarkets are also hotspots for infection to spread. It is originally how the virus spread in China so quickly in the wet markets of Wuhan.
            <br><br>
            The effect of the virus forced the government to implement measures in supermarkets. Including making surfaces sanitary, making workers and employers wear masks, and social distancing with a length of 6 feet. But all of this resulted in a much cleaner environment for us consumers.
            <br><br>
            Now that these new rules have been applied, changes could are obvious. Before you even enter the supermarket, social distancing effects are in place. During busy hours, you could see long lines that stretch outside the supermarket. This happens because supermarkets have maximum capacities, restricting the number of people allowed into the supermarket. This is beneficial in the safety of each customer, as well as making sure social distancing is happening even if customers are unaware of it. Another major change in supermarkets is sanitations. Sanitations happen much more frequently as well, with employees sanitating touched surfaces such as product shelves and shopping carts. Providing a cleaner surface so that even if there were traces of COVID-19 on surfaces, they would have been eliminated before further spreading.
            <br><br>
            In terms of cons, this new change has only brought us inconvenience and having to need the ability to adapt to these changes. Although we may forget about these new rules, we must be diligent in the way to interact with others in tight spaces. Being able to remember these rules will keep everyone safe in the future. Although it may be inconvenient sometimes to wait in a line much longer, we must remember this change is worthy of our diligence.
            <br><br>
            Adapting to these changes is still challenging for many, including myself. Being able to remember all these new rules have been inconvenient at times. The fear of COVID-19 has forced us to adapt, but I am certain it is for the good of ourselves and others.
