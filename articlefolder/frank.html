            Burnaby firefighters have been busy recently -- making two incredible rescues over the past few days. In addition to the well-known responsibilities of firefighters such as extinguishing fires using powerful water hoses and rescuing victims from emergencies caused by fires, they are also occasionally delegated the task of rescuing victims from numerous other emergency situations as well.<br><br>
            A few days ago, a 14-year-old mountain biker was injured after a crash on “Nicole’s Trail” near SFU according to @IAFF323, the official Burnaby Fire L323 twitter account. Fortunately, the teen did not lose his life and is now recovering from injuries. According to the WalkBC website, extreme caution is encouraged as this trail consists of numerous steep sections and drop-offs. This trail is listed as a “challenging hiking and mountain biking trail that ascends steeply on the south flank of Burnaby Mountain”.<br><br>
            If you are thinking of biking down this mountain trail in the future, make sure to prepare accordingly. For sufficient energy and hydration, bring water and snacks such as energy bars and fruits that are high in nutrition. Remember to confirm with a family member or friend that they know where you will be going, when you will be going, and when you will be back. This is one of the key points in ensuring a safe trip as another person will be aware of your whereabouts. In addition to these preparations, you can also plan out your route on many popular exercise and navigation apps such as Strava. Helmets are also useful when riding on such rigorous trails as they offer the necessary protection to prevent serious injuries. Contrary to common belief, cycling helmets are one-time use safety devices. According to the NY Times Wirecutter blog, “Once you compress the foam underneath the helmet’s plastic shell, it can no longer protect you.” This fact is valid no matter how new or old your helmet is. Taking this into account, you should regularly inspect your cycling helmet and search for any hairline cracks and replace the helmet as you see necessary to ensure full protection for the head if an incident does occur.
